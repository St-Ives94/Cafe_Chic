                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Founded in 1994, we studied the authenic world of Paris, France. Studied the culinary life in Paris and spent years of perfecting craft of authenic parisian deserts before opening our doors. </p>
                <p>"There is nothing about the Paris streets which more definitely strikes the British or American visitor than the café life on the pavements ... The Paris café remains in their minds as the typical café--something so foreign that there is no equivalent for its name in the English language. The old English coffee-house was not a café in the modern sense, and it has vanished now. So is also vanishing the Paris café in its most characteristic form." <strong>--George and Pearl Adam</strong> <i>A Book about Paris. London: Jonathan Cape, 1927</i></p>
